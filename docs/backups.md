Software is not fail-safe, especially a beta version. That's why we recommend making frequent backups of your data, specifically your project directories and the version databases. The location of the local version database of P4 One depends on the operating system you are using.

If you did not choose a custom location for the version database you will find it...


- ...on **macOS** at:

   `~/Library/Application Support/P4 One/VersionDB`


- ...on **Windows** at:

    `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\P4 One\VersionDB`
