The sidebar in P4 One contains an option called **Manage...** that allows you to organize your workspaces.

### Delete Workspace

You can delete a workspace including the version database by clicking the menu expansion icon <span className="more" /> on the right side of the table. Both, the project and the version database are moved to the trash/recycle bin.

### Restore Workspace

All projects whose versions are stored in the [version database](terminology.md#version-database) can be restored by P4 One. Within `Manage Workspaces` click **Restore project**. P4 One will restore the project at its original location.
