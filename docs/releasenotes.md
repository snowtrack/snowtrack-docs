### Better preview for Blender previews

Blender previews received an update through the enhanced viewport. Deformers, modifiers and armatures can be enabled through the **Enhanced Preview** option in the sidebar of the viewport.

### Add info message about ignored files

Snowtrack displays an updated message dialog when restoring an older version. We added the info that temporary files such as auto-saves or backup files are ignored. Such files are often created by applications like Photoshop, Cinema 4D, Blender, etc. and don't need to be stored in a version.

### New buttons to jump between modifications of items

The old buttons to switch between the next and previous version got replaced with buttons to switch between modifications.
